# High Stakes - 9204A Codebase (2024-2025 Season)

## Overview
This is the codebase for **9204A Dragons**' robot, which went **10-0** and earned **#1 seed** at the **2025 VEX Robotics World Championship Research Division**!
This was one of the most consistent and reliable bots we ever built, being able to bully other bots.

## Features
Here are features we would like to show:
* PID Loops

  PID systems were developed for the Ladybrown and drivetrain originally based on our own [PID Template](https://github.com/9204A-B/PID-Template). Later we adopted the [JAR-Template](https://github.com/JacksonAreaRobotics/JAR-Template).
  We are currently working on a new PID and odometry library called [DragonLib](https://github.com/9204A-B/dragonlib)

* Color Sorting

  Our robot could detect and sort rings by color to ensure that only alliance colored rings were scored, since scoring the wrong colored rings is not ideal.

* Auton Structure

  Our autonomous was designed to be fully modular and highly adaptable. With 36 variations pre-coded, we didn't need to rewrite routines during competition. This allowed instant adjustments based on alliance partners and match strategy.

## Thanks
> Thanks to everyone on 9204A for the best final year on the team! Go Dragons!üêâ - Logan Dresel
